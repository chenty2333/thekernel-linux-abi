# thekernel-linux-signal

`thekernel-linux-signal` provides bounded Linux signal queues, process/thread
signal managers, architecture signal frames, alternate-stack handling, and
transactional signal restore validation.

The caller owns every `ProcessSignalManager`, queue account, and thread
endpoint. There is no crate-global signal domain or implicit current process.
Thread IDs are unique within one process registry; registration is
rollback-safe and bounded by an immutable process-local endpoint limit. The
default is 65,536; `try_with_thread_limit()` selects a lower or other finite
limit, while `usize::MAX` is rejected as effective infinity. Explicit
cancellation stops later publication while draining and refunding queued
records. Process and thread endpoints may instead enter a retained state for
Linux zombie/group-leader teardown: retained endpoints leave ordinary routing
but preserve exact pending ownership until reap. Cancellation and retirement
both quiesce a delivery that already started, so handler context and mask
updates cannot complete after teardown returns.

Signal dispositions live in an opaque, reference-counted
`SharedSignalActions` owner. Cloning that owner implements `CLONE_SIGHAND` and
preserves an identity suitable for `KCMP_SIGHAND`; `try_snapshot()` implements
an independent fork snapshot without exposing the table lock to consumers.

Synchronous waits use `observe_signal_wait()` under that same sole delivery
owner. Each observation first accepts a queued signal selected by the caller's
wait set, then considers asynchronous delivery with that set explicitly
excluded. A selected signal published in the dequeue-to-delivery gap therefore
stays pending for the embedding wake and next observation instead of being
consumed into an asynchronous handler frame. The result distinguishes
accepted, delivered, and empty observations without exposing lock ownership to
consumers.

Registration is a two-phase operation. `try_register(tid)` returns an
admission token; dropping that token rolls the admission back, while
`commit()` activates it. `commit()` is fallible and returns
`ThreadRegistrationError::Cancelled` if concurrent teardown cancelled the
admission first. An embedding kernel must call `cancel_registration()` during
ordinary thread teardown, or `retire_registration()` when exact pending
ownership must survive in a retained leader.

Credential- or liveness-checked signal sends also have an explicit two-phase
path. `try_prepare_signal_send()` fallibly retains a bounded process routing
cohort before the kernel enters an unrelated IRQ-disabled authorization
transaction; the thread manager's `try_prepare_signal_send()` retains one
exact endpoint and registration identity. Their
`publish()` methods only take short signal-state spin locks, recheck exact
registration/lifecycle identity, and move preallocated queue ownership. The
returned deferred result retains every unused queue record, account, registry
entry, process manager, and endpoint until the kernel has left its outer
critical section. Process-route preparation is intentionally allowed to
allocate and take the sleepable registry mutex; publication is not.

Every actually published thread-private record receives a non-reusable
generation. Pre-delivery Retry/Fault returns the same owned record to the front
of its original queue without changing real-time FIFO order, `siginfo`, or
accounting. A one-shot delivery bypass matches both signal number and exact
generation, so coalesced or stale records cannot consume it. Generation
exhaustion is sticky and fails closed. Linux stop/continue generation effects
flush conflicting pending records across process, live-thread, and retained
leader queues.

Every userspace action/frame copy receives an explicit
`UserMemoryContext`; the crate never obtains the current task or address space.
Its only TheKernel Linux ABI workspace dependency is
`thekernel-linux-usercopy`. Action and frame copies accept Linux-compatible
unaligned userspace addresses.

Each `SignalQueueAccount` requires an explicit finite hard limit and rejects
`usize::MAX`. RLIMIT may further lower per-user admission, while a separate
finite global account prevents an infinity-valued RLIMIT from becoming
unbounded allocation.

All supported 64-bit signal-frame alignment holes are represented by explicit
zeroed fields before an object is written to userspace. `SignalInfo` keeps its
raw storage private so safe construction preserves the fully initialized-byte
invariant. Signal return first copies and validates an owned frame, filters
privileged processor state, validates `uc_stack` through caller-supplied
address/minimum-size policy, and only then commits context, mask, and any valid
alternate-stack update. As on Linux, non-copy `restore_altstack()` errors are
recorded on `PreparedSignalRestore` but do not reject machine-context restore.
`SS_AUTODISARM` is not advertised in 0.1.0.

`SA_RESETHAND` delivery uses one non-duplicable claim per disposition
generation. Copyout failure rolls the claim back, a concurrent replacement
invalidates it, and generation exhaustion is a typed error rather than an ABA
wrap. Signal frames expose the actual interrupted alternate-stack snapshot,
including computed `SS_ONSTACK` state.

Version 0.1.0 is nightly-only because fallible `Arc::try_new` queue and
endpoint allocation requires `allocator_api`. It follows the workspace's
rolling nightly toolchain and does not claim a stable `rust-version`.

The 0.1.0 release-supported target is x86_64. Signal frames and the restorer
layout are fixed to the Linux x86_64 ABI.

Bare-metal consumers must enable `multitask`, so delivery quiescence and
action/registry publication use the sleepable `axsync::Mutex`. A bare-metal
no-feature build is rejected at compile time instead of holding `SpinNoIrq`
across usercopy or fallible allocation. Hosted standalone tests retain a spin
fallback where no kernel IRQ state exists. `kspin/smp` remains enabled in every
build, including unpacked-package concurrency tests.

The immutable thread-registry pointer also uses that sleepable kernel mutex:
strong snapshot acquisition never clones an `Arc` with interrupts disabled.
Registration rollback and endpoint destruction first move any retained
registry owner out of their short IRQ-safe slot, then release it after the
guard is gone. Process-directed routing is therefore a sleepable task-context
operation in 0.1.0; an interrupt-context sender must defer routing through its
kernel adapter rather than smuggling allocation or destruction into a spin
critical section.

The process publication cohort is a correctness-first 0.1 representation. It
is finite and allocation failure is explicit; its `Vec` layout, snapshot
algorithm, and future RCU/epoch optimization are not stable API guarantees.
